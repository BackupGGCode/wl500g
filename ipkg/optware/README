This repository contains several packages compiled using optware toolchain.
The hardware platform is of course asus wl500g series of the routers with
oleg as optware target. The intention is to bring UTF-8 support into some
of the packages, and to provide some experimental packages for testing and
usage. It is not intended to replace original optware repository in any
means.

We suggest two methods of usage of this repository.
1. For beginners:
Download ipk file on your router and install them just by:

ipkg install ipkfile.ipk

2. For advanced users (this method still requires more testing):
Update the content of the /opt/etc/ipkg.conf in the following way
(our repository has to be recoreded after the default optware one):

src/gz optware http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/oleg/cross/stable
src/gz wl500g-optware http://wl500g.googlecode.com/svn/ipkg/optware
dest /opt/ /

And then use these two repositories in parallel. They will interact in the 
following way:
- if both repositories contain a package with the same name and version, then 
  the version from googlecode will be installed;
- if names are the same, but the versions are different, then the package 
  with higher version number will be installed;
- if a package from googlecode has dependenses against the original optware 
  packages they will be automatically installed.

Finally, the src directory is intended to be used as a sort of notebook. 
It contains all the files which were modified to allow building of the 
package (.mk, patches, .conf files) through the optware toolchain. The 
packages to be placed in this repository will be accepted only if these 
sources are provided. Due to volatile nature of the optware sources the 
.diff files are not intended to be used directly. They are provided just 
to facilitate overview of the changes performed.
